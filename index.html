    <p>My name is Gabriella Álvarez, and I have been involved in graphic design since middle school when I would sneak down to my Mom’s computer in the middle of the night and design graphics for players on various games. Now, I have a BA in Visual Communication Design, with a double minor in Digital Entrepreneurship Experience, Technical Communication and a User Experience Certificate.<br>

        <br>I utilize my skills to give back to my community, so some of my favorite projects involve the ones that are for 501(c)(3) organizations. Even though much of my work is spent in the digital world, I manage my life with the classical tools of pen and paper.<br>
        
        <br>When I’m not writing lines of code or drawing logos with the pen tool, you can always find me with a book in hand or my camera. I love photographing my beautiful city and spending hours consuming a novel with a cup of tea.</p>
